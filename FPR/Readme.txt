Files and their descriptions are as follows-

1) Walking_Data_Analysis.ipynb ----> Used to analyse the given dataset and segregate into two parts based on the location of the video (beach and home).

2) Walking_next_frame_prediction.ipynb ----> Used for next frame prediction of the ConvLSTM model.

3) Walking_continuous_frame_prediction.ipynb ----> Used for predicting continuous block of frames from an already seen block of frames.

4) Deblurring.ipynb ----> Used to train the restormer model for both motion deblurring and image denoising.

5) Proposed Model.ipynb ----> Final implementation of the proposed pipeline to predict the next frame, deblur/denoise it and predict future frames.

6) tmp.pth ----> Weights for the ConvLSTM model.

7) denoising.pth --> Weigths for image denoising model.
